This program analyses the death index files from the SSA/INEGI to generate some summary statistics (age, time of day, occupation, etc)

You'll need the death index files from the SSA/INEGI available at

[SINAIS](http://sinais.salud.gob.mx/basesdedatos/index.html#estatica)

for the moment you'll have to convert them manually and place them in the /data directory, but this will change in the future
